/*
=====================================================
Create Gold Layer Views (Star Schema)
=====================================================
Script Purpose:
This script creates the analytical layer of the DataWarehouse by defining
dimension and fact views in the gold schema. These views are built on top
of the cleaned and transformed silver layer and are structured in a star
schema format to support reporting and business intelligence workloads.

Objects Created:
- gold.dim_customers  → Customer dimension with demographic and location data
- gold.dim_products   → Product dimension with category and product details
- gold.fact_sales     → Sales fact table containing transactional measures

Warning:
This script drops and recreates the gold views. Any dependent reports,
queries, or BI models may be temporarily affected during execution.
